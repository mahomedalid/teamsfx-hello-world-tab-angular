# Getting Started with Hello World Tab Sample (Azure)

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context. Most of the Microsoft Teams documentation uses React.

Hello World Tab Angular shows you how to build a tab app in Angular.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), fully tested on NodeJS 14, 16
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## What you will learn in this sample:

- How to use TeamsFx to build frontend hosting on Azure for your tab app.

## Try the Sample with Visual Studio Code Extension:
>Here are the instructions to run the sample in **Visual Studio Code**. You can also try to run the app using TeamsFx CLI tool, refer to [Try the Sample with TeamsFx CLI](cli.md)
1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit).
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.

## Use the App in Teams

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams manifest in `templates/appPackage` folder. The templates contains:
* `manifest.template.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally and remotely.

Both file contains template arguments with `{...}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

| From Visual Studio Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | From TeamsFx CLI                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <ul><li>Open Teams Toolkit, and sign into Azure by clicking the `Sign in to Azure` under the `ACCOUNTS` section from sidebar.</li> <li>After you signed in, select a subscription under your account.</li><li>Open the Teams Toolkit and click `Provision in the cloud` from DEPLOYMENT section or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Provision in the cloud`.</li><li>Open the Teams Toolkit and click `Deploy to the cloud` or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Deploy to the cloud`.</li></ul> | <ul> <li>Run command `teamsfx account login azure`.</li> <li>Run command `teamsfx account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>`.</li> <li> Run command `teamsfx provision`.</li> <li>Run command: `teamsfx deploy`. </li></ul> |

> Note: Provisioning and deployment may incur charges to your Azure Subscription.

## Package

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select `Teams: Zip Teams metadata package`.
- Alternatively, from the command line run `teamsfx package` in the project directory.

## Publish to Teams

Once deployed, you may want to distribute your application to your organization's internal app store in Teams. Your app will be submitted for admin approval.

- From Visual Studio Code: open the Teams Toolkit and click `Publish to Teams` or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Publish to Teams`.
- From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx publish` in your project directory.

## Architecture

- The frontend is a react tab app hosted on [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/).

### Angular 2 specifics

This is a very simple Angular 2 app, it was created directly from the boilerplate generated by the `ng` tool. The only main changes are: 

- Microsoft teams dependencies are included in the [package.json](tabs/package.json)
- `teamsfx` requires a `build` folder instead of `dist`, and the `build` command in [package.json](tabs/package.json) was modified to include `--output-path=build`.

### Code structure

- You can check app configuration and environment information in: [.fx](.fx)
- You will find frontend code in: [tabs/src/](tabs/src/)
